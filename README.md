# Global_Health_Indicators

### Data Science analysis on global health indicators based on WHO data.


## Overview 


### Objective 

The goal of this project is to uncover insights into global health indicators by comparing data on alcohol and tobacco use, physical activity, and overweight prevalence across countries and genders. This analysis aims to identify potential factors that contribute to healthier lifestyle choices and patterns within populations.

The quantitative outcome added to political, cultural and economical context, suggests a positive impact on regulations to lower consumption rates of tobacco and alcohol. Additionally an increase in physical activity when a Country has higher availability of recreational facilities and other public health initiatives.

The data is sourced from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Health Observatory and includes the following four health indicators:

> - Alcohol Consumption (2020)
> - Tobacco Consumption (2020)
> - Insufficient Physical Activity Among Adults (Estimated 2022)
> - Overweight Prevalence Among Adults (2022)


### Motivation

Understanding human behavioral trends is essential for both public and private sector organizations. By identifying behavior patterns, public institutions can more effectively target specific health issues and develop initiatives to improve population well-being.
For private companies, refined consumer profiles based on health behavior can help tailor products and services to better serve their audiences, whether profit-driven or non-profit. This research aims to encourage social initiatives geared towards fostering community health and development.

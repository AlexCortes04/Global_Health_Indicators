# Global_Health_Indicators

## Data Science analysis on global health indicators based on WHO data.

## Overview 

### Objetive 

The goal of this project is to uncover insights into global health indicators by comparing data on alcohol and tobacco use, physical activity, and overweight prevalence across countries and genders. This analysis aims to identify potential factors that contribute to healthier lifestyle choices and patterns within populations.

### Data

The data is sourced from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Health Observatory and includes the following four health indicators:

> - Alcohol Consumption (2020)
> - Tobacco Consumption (2020)
> - Insufficient Physical Activity Among Adults (Estimated 2022)
> - Overweight Prevalence Among Adults (2022)

### Motivation

Understanding human behavioral trends is essential for both public and private sector organizations. By identifying behavior patterns, public institutions can more effectively target specific health issues and develop initiatives to improve population well-being.

For private companies, refined consumer profiles based on health behavior can help tailor products and services to better serve their audiences, whether profit-driven or non-profit. This research aims to encourage social initiatives geared towards fostering community health and development.


### Tools and Libraries
Python (with libraries: Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib)

### Methodology used 
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Hypothesis Testing (using Z-tests)
 - Correlation test (using Spearman’s correlation test)


## Key Insights

- **Alcohol Consumption:** Patterns in alcohol consumption are closely associated with cultural and religious contexts, as well as social norms.

- **Tobacco Consumption:** Tobacco usage is influenced by regional regulations and cultural acceptance, with economic factors also playing a significant role.

- **Physical Activity:** Levels of physical activity may be shaped by factors such as public health initiatives, availability of recreational facilities, and cultural traditions, with some societies exhibiting higher rates of sedentary behavior.

- **Overweight Prevalence:** Dietary habits appear to be a primary determinant of overweight prevalence in different countries. Cultural and economic factors likely have a significant impact on these patterns.

## Conclusion

This analysis suggests that health indicators like alcohol and tobacco use, physical activity, and overweight prevalence are strongly influenced by cultural, economic, and regulatory factors. Recognizing these patterns can provide insights into designing more effective health policies and tailored social programs that promote healthier lifestyle choices on a global scale.
